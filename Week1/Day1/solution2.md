### ‚úÖ **Question (Problem Statement)**
* Declare a variable `a`.
* Set the value of `a` to `1`.
* Repeat the following steps while a is less than 5:

   * Increment the value of `a` by 2.
* Print the value of `a`.
* Find how many times the `While` loop executed.

### üß† **Pseudo Code**

````
Integer a
Set a = 1
while(a<5)
   a=a+2
end while
print(a)
 ````
-------

### üîç **Step-by-Step Analysis**
* We declare a variable `a` of Integer.
* Set the value of `a` is `1`.
    *  `a=1`
* Check if the condition in `while` loop is true or not:
  * If `a` is less than 5 then it enter in the loop.
  * Increment the value of a by 2.
      * `a=a+2` -> `a=1+2`.
  * the While loop executed 2 times.So, the answer is 2.
